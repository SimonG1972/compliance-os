We do not engage in profiling which results in legal or similarly significant effects, as defined under applicable law. How We Share Childrenâs Information We may share the information that we collect with our corporate group or service providers as necessary for them to support the internal operations of the TikTok service. We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law (i) in response to a court order or a subpoena, or similar legal process; (ii) in response to a law enforcement or public agencyâs (including schools or children services) request; (iii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, to facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of Children using our sites or applications; (iv) to protect the security and integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (v) to enable us to take precautions against liability. TikTok does not sell information from Children to third parties and does not share such information with third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. Data Security and Retention We make efforts to treat Childrenâs information securely and in accordance with this policy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we take steps to protect this information, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the TikTok services; any transmission is at the userâs own risk. We employ technical and organizational measures designed to achieve a level of security appropriate to risks of varying likelihood and severity and that takes into the account the rights and freedoms of users. We maintain these technical and organizational measures and will amend them from time"
