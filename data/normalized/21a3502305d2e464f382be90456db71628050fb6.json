If you live in North America or South America, the contract is between you and Etsy, Inc.; if you live elsewhere, the contract is between you and Etsy Ireland UC, a subsidiary of Etsy, Inc. Weâ€™ll just refer to Etsy, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries collectively as â€œEtsy.â€\nIf you are a buyer on Etsy, the Etsy entity acting as merchant of record may vary depending on the currency and location of your payment instrument.  The merchant of record is Etsy, Inc., 117 Adams St, Brooklyn, NY 11201 if you reside in the US; Etsy Ireland UC, One Le Pole Square, Ship Street Great, Dublin 8, Ireland if you reside in the EU; Etsy UK Limited, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, England BS13 8FD if you reside in the UK (UK); Etsy Canada Limited, 22 Adelaide Street West, Suite 3600, Toronto ON M5H 4E3,  if you reside in Canada; Etsy Australia Pty Limited, Yarra Falls, 452 Johnston Street, Abbotsford, Victoria 3067 if you reside in Australia; and Etsy Ireland UC, One Le Pole Square, Ship Street Great, Dublin 8, Ireland, if you reside in the rest of the world.\nPlease note that Section 11 contains an arbitration clause and class action waiver, applicable to users in North and South America, and explains how to opt out of arbitration. Unless you validly opt out, you agree to resolve any disputes with Etsy exclusively through binding individual arbitration, with only limited exceptions. This means you and Etsy are waiving the right to sue in court, have a trial by jury, or participate in a class or representative action. Please read this Section carefully, as it affects your rights.\nThis contract sets out your rights and responsibilities when you use Etsy.com, Pattern by Etsy, our mobile apps, and the other services provided by Etsy (weâ€™ll refer to all of these collectively as our â€œServicesâ€), so please read it carefully.

Our Privacy Policy details how your information is collected, used and shared when you use our Services. By using our Services, you're also agreeing that we can process your information in the ways set out in the Privacy Policy, so please read it here .\nBoth Etsy and sellers process membersâ€™ personal information (for example, buyer name, email address, and shipping address) and are therefore consideredÂ separate and independent data controllersÂ of buyersâ€™ personal information under EU law. That means that each party is responsible for the personal information it processes in providing the Services. For example, if a seller accidentally discloses a buyerâ€™s name and email address when fulfilling another buyerâ€™s order, the seller, not Etsy, will be responsible for that unauthorized disclosure. Â\nIf, however, you (as a seller) and Etsy are found to be joint data controllers of buyersâ€™ personal information, and if Etsy is sued, fined, or otherwise incurs expenses because of something that you did (or failed to do) as a joint data controller of buyer personal information, then you agree to defend and indemnify Etsy in accordance with Section 9 below.",

      "text": "Youâ€™ll need to create an account with Etsy to use some of our Services. Here are a few rules about accounts with Etsy:\nA. You must be 18 years or older to use our Services. Minors under 18 and at least 13 years of age are only permitted to use our Services through an account owned by a parent or legal guardian with their appropriate permission and under their direct supervision. Children under 13 years are not permitted to use Etsy or the Services. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account, and there may be commercial products or services available that you may want to consider to limit a minor's access to material online. For more information, see Etsy's Minors Policy .\nB. Be honest with us. Provide accurate information about yourself. Itâ€™s prohibited to use false information or impersonate another person or company through your account.\nC. Choose an appropriate name. If you decide to not have your full name serve as the name associated with your account, you may not use language that is offensive, vulgar, infringes someoneâ€™s intellectual property rights, or otherwise violates the Terms.\nD. You're responsible for your account. Youâ€™re solely responsible for any activity on your account. If youâ€™re sharing an account with other people, then the person whose financial information is on the account will ultimately be responsible for all activity. If youâ€™re registering as a business entity, you personally guarantee that you have the authority to agree to the Terms on behalf of the business. Accounts are generally not transferable.\nE. Protect your password. As we mentioned above, youâ€™re solely responsible for any activity on your account, so itâ€™s important to keep your account password secure. Hereâ€™s a Help article on how to make your account more secure .\nF. Let's be clear about our relationship. These Terms don't create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or franchisee relationship between you and Etsy.\nG. Cases and Appeals. To participate in our case system (as described in Section 10), or to appeal an action by Etsy, you must have an account.\nThis detailed Help article should answer any questions you may have about registering an account with Etsy.",

      "title": "5. Your Content",
      "text": "Content that you post using our Services is your content (so letâ€™s refer to it as â€œYour Contentâ€). We donâ€™t make any claim to it, which includes anything you post using our Services (like shop names, profile pictures, listing photos, listing descriptions, reviews, comments, videos, usernames, etc.).\nA. Responsibility for Your Content. You understand that you are solely responsible for Your Content. You represent that you have all necessary rights to all parts of Your Content and that youâ€™re not infringing or violating any third partyâ€™s rights by posting it.\nB. Permission to Use Your Content . By posting Your Content through our Services, you grant Etsy and, as authorized by Etsy in its sole discretion, third parties, a license to use it. We donâ€™t claim any ownership to Your Content, but we have your permission to use it to help Etsy function and grow. That way, we wonâ€™t infringe any rights you have in Your Content and we can help promote it. For example, you acknowledge and agree Etsy may offer you or Etsy buyers promotions on the Site, from time to time, that may relate to your listings or other listings on Etsy.\nC. Rights You Grant Etsy. (Hereâ€™s the legalese version of the last section). By posting Your Content, you grant Etsy and, as authorized by Etsy in its sole discretion, third parties, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use, display, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, store, and prepare derivative works of Your Content. This allows us to provide the Services and to promote Etsy, your Etsy shop, other shops and listings, or the Services in general, in any formats and through any channels, including across any Etsy Services, our partners, or third-party website or advertising medium. You agree not to assert any moral rights or rights of publicity against us for using Your Content. You also recognize our legitimate interest in using it, in accordance with the scope of this license, to the extent Your Content contains any personal information.\nThat sounds like a lot, but itâ€™s necessary for us to keep Etsy going. Consider these examples: if you upload a photo or video of a listing on your Etsy shop, we have permission to display it to buyers, and we can resize or enhance it so it looks good to a buyer using our mobile app; if you post a description in English, we can translate it into French so a buyer in Paris can learn the story behind your item; and if you post a beautiful photo or video of your latest handmade necklace, we can feature itâ€“ often along with your shop name and shop pictureâ€“ on our homepage, in one of our blogs or even on a billboard to help promote your business and Etsyâ€™s.\nD. Reporting Unauthorized Content. Etsy has great respect for intellectual property rights, and is committed to following appropriate legal procedures to remove infringing content from the Services. If content that you own or have rights to has been posted to the Services without your permission and you want it removed, please follow the steps listed in our Intellectual Property Policy . If Your Content is alleged to infringe another personâ€™s intellectual property, we will take appropriate action, such as disabling it if we receive a report of infringement that complies with our policies, or terminating your account if you are found to be a repeat infringer. Weâ€™ll notify you if any of that happens.\nE. Inappropriate, False, or Misleading Content. This should be common sense, but there are certain types of content we donâ€™t want posted on Etsyâ€™s Services (for legal reasons or otherwise). You agree that you will not post any content that is abusive, threatening, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, or otherwise offensive or in violation of our Prohibited Items Policy , Community Policy , or any part of our Terms. You also agree not to post any content that is false and misleading or uses the Services in a manner that is fraudulent or deceptive.",

Where applicable, Etsy will calculate, collect and remit value-added tax or VAT and sales tax.

Talk to Us Online. From time to time, Etsy will provide you with certain legal information in writing. By using our Services, youâ€™re agreeing to our Electronic Communications Policy , which describes how we provide that information to you. It says that we can send you information electronically (such as by email) instead of mailing you paper copies (itâ€™s better for the environment), and that your electronic agreement is the same as your signature on paper.",

      "text": "If youâ€™re upset with us, let us know, and weâ€™ll work together in good faith to resolve your issue. But if we canâ€™t work it out, then you and Etsy (including our employees, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, and affiliates) agree to submit our disputes exclusively to binding individual arbitration, and we wonâ€™t sue each other in court before a judge or jury, except in the limited circumstances described below.\nThis Section 11 (which weâ€™ll also refer to as the â€œArbitration Agreementâ€ or â€œAgreementâ€) applies only if you are a user in North or South America, and applies to the fullest extent allowable by law.\nPlease read this Section carefully, as it affects your rights.\nA. Disputes that Weâ€™ll Arbitrate. You and Etsy agree to mandatory individual arbitration for all claims arising from or relating to the Services, these and prior versions of the Terms, any products, data, or content bought, sold, offered, accessed, displayed, transmitted, or listed through the Services, and actions or statements by Etsy or its users, in each case including disputes that arose before the effective date of these Terms (each, a â€œ Dispute â€). The exception is that we each may (1) bring qualifying individual claims in â€œsmall claimsâ€ court, so long as those claims remain in small claims court; and (2) seek injunctive relief in court for infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights (like trademarks, copyrights, and patents). All other Disputes must be arbitrated, which means you and Etsy are each waiving your right to sue in court and have a court or jury trial.\nB. Class and Representative Action Waiver. You and Etsy agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not on a class, representative, or collective basis (and we each waive any right we have to bring such claims). We each may only seek or obtain individualized relief, and, except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), disputes between us cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other person or entity. If there is a final decision (after exhaustion of all appeals) that any part of this Section 11.B is unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (e.g., public injunctive relief), then solely that particular claim or request for relief shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in court (but only after the arbitrator issues an award on the arbitrable claims and remedies).\nC. Informal Dispute Resolution. Before filing an arbitration, you and Etsy will try in good faith to resolve any Dispute informally. To start the dispute process, you must send an individualized written notice (â€œNotice of Disputeâ€) to disputeresolution@etsy.com that includes (1) your name, phone number, the email address for your account, username and shop name (if applicable), and (2) a description of the Dispute and how youâ€™d like it resolved. If Etsy has a Dispute with you, we will send a Notice of Dispute with the same information to the email address for your account. Once a complete Notice of Dispute has been received, the recipient has 60 days to investigate the claims. If either side requests a settlement conference during this period, then you and Etsy must cooperate to schedule that meeting by phone or videoconference. You and Etsy each will personally participate and can each bring counsel, but the conference must be individualized, even if the same firm(s) represent multiple parties. For the claims in the Notice of Dispute, any statute of limitations will be tolled from the date the notice is received until the later of (i) 60 days, or (ii) after a timely requested settlement conference is completed (â€œInformal Resolution Periodâ€). An arbitration cannot be filed until the Informal Resolution Period has ended, and a court can enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration in breach of this Section.\nD. Arbitration Rules and Procedures. To initiate arbitration, either you or we must file an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (â€œAAAâ€). You must serve Etsy with any arbitration demand by mail to: Etsy, Inc. c/o United Agent Group Inc., 1521 Concord Pike, Suite 201, Wilmington, DE 19803. If Etsy has a dispute with you, we will send an arbitration demand to the email address for your account. If the AAA cannot or will not administer the arbitration in accordance with Section 11, you and we will select another provider (and if we canâ€™t agree, a court will choose the provider).\nThe arbitration will be conducted in the English language by a single arbitrator. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the arbitrator, (i) if the amount in dispute is less than $25,000, the arbitration will be conducted as a documents-only arbitration (i.e., there will be no in-person or telephonic hearing); and (ii) if the amount in dispute is $25,000 or more, the arbitration will be held by videoconference (i.e., there will be no in-person hearing). If an in-person hearing is required, it will be held in the county where you live (for US residents), New York County, New York (for non-US residents), or as determined by the arbitrator (in the case of Batch Arbitration).\nThe arbitration will be decided under AAAâ€™s Consumer Arbitration Rules , as modified by this Agreement. But if you are using the Services as a business (e.g., a seller or developer) and either your or Etsyâ€™s claims exceed $75,000, the AAAâ€™s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply, as modified by this Agreement. As in court, the arbitrator shall apply governing law and any counsel must comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b); and the arbitrator may impose any sanctions available under the AAA Rules, Rule 11, or other applicable law. The arbitrator also shall enforce statutes of limitations and other time-based defenses, offers of judgment/compromise, and fee-shifting rules in the same way as a court would.\nThe arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve all issues, except that a court has exclusive authority to decide issues related to the arbitrability of a dispute, the enforceability of any part of this Section 11 (Arbitration and Dispute Resolution Agreement (North and South America)), and either partyâ€™s compliance with Section 11.C (Informal Dispute Resolution). Except as provided in Section 11.F (Batch Arbitration), the arbitrator can award damages and other relief only in favor of the individual claimant, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimantâ€™s individual claim(s). The arbitrator will not be bound by decisions reached in other arbitrations. The arbitratorâ€™s award is final and binding on you and Etsy. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.\nE. Arbitration Fees. Payment of all filing, case-management, administrative, hearing, and arbitrator fees (â€œArbitration Feesâ€) will be governed by the AAAâ€™s rules and fee schedules, unless otherwise stated in this Arbitration Agreement. If you are using the Services as a consumer and your share of Arbitration Fees is more than youâ€™d otherwise pay in court, let us know, and Etsy will pay the difference on your behalf.\nF. Batch Arbitration. To ensure efficient resolution, if within a 90-day period, 25 or more claimants submit Notices of Dispute or file arbitrations raising similar claims (i.e., with the same or similar facts or events and legal issues) and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, the disputes must be arbitrated in batches of up to 100 claimants each (â€œBatchâ€). Specifically, upon notice from either side, the AAA shall group the claimants into: (1) a single Batch (if there are 25-100 claimants), or (2) Batches of 100 claimants each, with a smaller, final Batch consisting of any remaining claimants (if there are more than 100 claimants). The AAA shall thereafter provide for the resolution of each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with a single arbitrator appointed by the AAA, one set of Arbitration Fees, and one hearing (if any) per Batch to be held by videoconference (or in a place decided by the arbitrator). The parties will cooperate in good faith to implement this process and minimize the time and costs of arbitration, and agree that the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules shall apply, except as provided in this Section. Any challenges to administrative determinations by AAA shall be heard by a single process arbitrator. If this Section 11.F is deemed unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, then it shall be severed as to that claimant or Batch, and those parties shall arbitrate in individual proceedings.\nG. Opt out. If you are a new user of our Services, you can opt out of this Arbitration Agreement (excluding Section 11.I) within 30 days after you first accept the Terms. To opt out, you must send a timely email to arbitrationoptout@etsy.com with your name, the email address for your account, your username and your shop name (if applicable), and a request to opt out of arbitration. If you validly opt out, neither Etsy nor you will be required to arbitrate as a result of this (or any prior version of the) Arbitration Agreement, but the Terms (and any other agreements between us) will otherwise apply to you. If we update the Terms after you validly opt out, we will continue to respect your opt-out, but such updates do not provide a new opportunity to opt out of arbitration.\nH. Future Changes to the Arbitration Agreement. Etsy will notify you of material changes to this Arbitration Agreement at least 30 days before they become effective. You may reject future changes to the Arbitration Agreement by emailing arbitrationchanges@etsy.com within 30 days after you receive notice, including your name, email address associated with your account, your username, and shop name (if applicable). Otherwise, youâ€™ll be bound by the change, and the modified Arbitration Agreement shall apply to all Disputes between you and Etsy, including those arising before the effective date of the changes, but excluding any claims pending in arbitration (or court, if permitted) as of the effective date. If you reject a change, youâ€™ll be bound by the most recent version of the Arbitration Agreement before the change you rejected.\nI. Choice of Law and Forum. Etsy is based in New York, so if there are claims between you and Etsy that arenâ€™t subject to arbitration, you and Etsy each agree to litigate those claims exclusively in state or federal court in New York County, New York, and to submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. The exception is if you file in small claims courtâ€“you can do that in the county of your residence. Except as prohibited by law, these Terms shall be governed exclusively by New York law, without regard to conflict-of-law rules, and U.S. federal law (including the Federal Arbitration Act). However, if you are based in Canada, you may instead bring any non-arbitrable claims in the courts and under the laws (including federal law) of either Quebec (if you are an individual or sole proprietor in Quebec), or Ontario. For clarity, this Section 11.I will continue to apply even if you validly opt out of arbitration under Section 11.G.",

Because your contract is with Etsy Ireland UC, we each agree that the Terms and any disputes between us will be exclusively governed by Irish law, and exclusively decided in the courts of Ireland, except to the extent prohibited by law. However, if you are based in Australia, the Terms and any disputes will be governed by the laws and courts of Australia. If you are using the Services as an individual consumer, you may be entitled to invoke the mandatory consumer protection laws of your country of residence, and/or to bring legal proceedings in the courts of that country.  If Etsy needs to enforce its rights against you as an individual consumer, we will do so only in your country of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is excluded.\nIf a dispute arises between you and Etsy, we encourage you to contact Etsy Support to seek a resolution, and/or to follow the Informal Dispute Resolution process outlined in Section 11.C above. For EU sellers, Etsy provides a complaint-handling system that is available free of charge and easily accessible. Information about the Platform-to-Business (â€œP2Bâ€) Regulation is here , including information about how we handle complaints. You may raise a concern or complaint related to P2B here . You or Etsy also may refer qualifying disputes to mediation before the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution or resolution through the European Commission's online dispute resolution platform .

You may also be entitled to engage with a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body . If any of the certified out-of-court dispute settlement bodies need to contact Etsy, we ask that you please contact legal@etsy.com.",
