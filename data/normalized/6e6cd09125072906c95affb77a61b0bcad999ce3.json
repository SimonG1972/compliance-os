      "title": "FTC's Endorsement Guides: What People Are Asking",
      "text": "Tags:\nAdvertising and Marketing\nEndorsements, Influencers, and Reviews\nOnline Advertising and Marketing\nCredit and Finance\nFinTech\nSuppose you meet someone who tells you about a great new product. The person says it performs wonderfully and offers fantastic new features that nobody else has. Would that recommendation factor into your decision to buy the product? Probably.\nNow suppose the person works for the company that sells the product or has been paid by the company to tout the product. Would you want to know that when youâ€™re evaluating the personâ€™s glowing recommendation? You bet. That common-sense premise is at the heart of the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s (FTC) Endorsement Guides . The Guides, at their core, reflect the basic truth-in-advertising principle that endorsements must be honest and not misleading. An endorsement must reflect the honest opinion of the endorser and canâ€™t be used to make a claim the marketer of the product couldnâ€™t legally make.\nIn addition, the Guides say, if thereâ€™s a connection between an endorser and the marketer that a significant minority of consumers wouldnâ€™t expect and it would affect how they evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed clearly and conspicuously. For example, if an ad features an endorser who is a relative or employee of the marketer, the ad is misleading unless the connection is made clear. The same is usually true if the endorser has been paid or given something of value to tout the product. The reason is obvious: Knowing about the connection is important information for anyone evaluating the endorsement.\nSay youâ€™re planning a vacation. You do some research and find a glowing YouTube video review saying that a particular resort is the most luxurious place the reviewer has ever stayed. If you knew the hotel had paid the reviewer hundreds of dollars to say great things about it or that the reviewer had stayed there for several days for free, it could affect how much weight youâ€™d give the endorsement. The reviewer should, therefore, let viewers know about that relationship.\nAnother principle in the Guides applies to ads that feature endorsements from people who achieved exceptional, or even above average, results. An example is an endorser who claims to have lost 20 pounds in two months using the advertised product. If the advertiser doesnâ€™t have proof that the endorserâ€™s experience represents what people will generally achieve using the product as described in the ad (for example, by just taking a pill daily for two months), an ad featuring that endorser must make clear to the audience what the generally expected results of following that same regimen are.\nHere are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions from advertisers, ad agencies, influencers, bloggers, and others. Our staff guidance canâ€™t be definitive because the context of any particular endorsement is very important in determining whether a disclosure is needed and whether a particular disclosure is sufficient. Given that much of our guidance depends on consumer understanding, there will be times when we donâ€™t have sufficient information about what consumers know, what they understand, and how they behave. Moreover, all these factors depend on the context or may change over time. This guidance doesnâ€™t provide a safe harbor from potential liability; whether a particular advertising claim is deceptive or otherwise violates the FTC Act will depend on the facts of the specific case.\nIn addition, we recommend that you read the latest version of the Endorsement Guides , which were revised in 2023 with new or revised principles, examples, and definitions, including a new definition of â€œclearly and conspicuously.â€ We also have Disclosures 101 for Social Media Influencers and Soliciting and Paying for Online Reviews: A Guide for Marketers , both of which are short and easy-to-read documents with basic guidance.\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nAbout the Endorsement Guides\nWhen Does the FTC Act Apply to Product Recommendations?\nProduct Placements\nEndorsements by Ordinary Consumers on Social Media\nHow Should I Disclose That I Was Given Something for My Endorsement?\nOther Things for Endorsers and Advertisers to Know\nSocial Media Contests\nOnline Review Programs\nSoliciting Endorsements\nWhat are an Advertiser â€™ s Responsibilities for What Others Say on Social Media?\nWhat About Intermediaries?\nWhat About Affiliate or Network Marketing?\nExpert Endorsers Making Claims Outside of Traditional Advertisements\nEmployee Endorsements\nUsing Endorsements That Donâ€™t Reflect the Typical Consumer Experience",

      "title": "ABOUT THE ENDORSEMENT GUIDES What is an endorsement?",
      "text": "According to the dictionary, an endorsement is a recommendation of something or an expression of approval or support for something, but the Endorsement Guides are talking about a particular type of endorsement. As used in the Guides, an endorsement is an advertising message that consumers are likely to believe reflects the opinions or beliefs of someone other than the sponsoring advertiser. So, if the message isnâ€™t an advertising message by or on behalf of a marketer, it isnâ€™t an endorsement.",

      "title": "Do the Endorsement Guides apply to social media?",

      "text": "It may be common knowledge that some of them get paid this way, but others may have no connection to marketers whose products they mention. They may not get a commission or anything else for their recommendations, which they may be making only because they believe in those products.\nMoreover, the existence of financial arrangements between some content creators and advertisers may be apparent to some people, but not to everyone. Under the law, an act or practice is deceptive if it misleads â€œa significant minorityâ€ of consumers. Thatâ€™s why disclosure is important.",

      "title": "Are you monitoring social media influencers and bloggers?",
      "text": "If concerns about possible violations of the FTC Act come to our attention, we evaluate them case by case. If law enforcement becomes necessary, our focus usually will be on advertisers or their ad agencies and public relations firms. However, action against an individual endorser might be appropriate in certain circumstances â€“ for example, if the endorser hasnâ€™t made required disclosures despite warnings.",

    },
    {
      "title": "Does the FTC hold influencers and bloggers to a higher standard than reviewers for traditional media outlets?",
      "text": "No. The FTC Act applies across the board. The issue is â€“ and always has been â€“ whether the audience understands the reviewerâ€™s relationship to the company whose products are being recommended. If the audience understands the relationship, a disclosure isnâ€™t needed.\nIf youâ€™re employed by a newspaper or TV station to give reviews â€“ whether online or offline â€“ your audience probably understands that your job is to provide your personal opinion on behalf of your employer. In that situation, itâ€™s clear that you didnâ€™t buy the product yourself â€“ whether itâ€™s a book or a car or a movie ticket. But people viewing a review on social media, in a blog, or in an online video might not realize that the reviewer has a relationship with the company whose products are being recommended. Disclosure of that relationship helps readers decide how much weight to give the review.",

However, practices inconsistent with the Guides may result in law enforcement actions alleging Section 5 violations. Law enforcement actions can result in orders requiring the defendants in the case to pay money that goes back to consumers harmed as a result of their violations and to abide by various requirements in the future. Moreover, if the defendants received a Notice of Penalty Offenses regarding endorsements and then engaged in certain deceptive or unfair endorsement practices, the FTC could seek substantial civil penalties.",

      "title": "Can a brand hire several influencers to post the same content created by the brand and not the influencers themselves (e.g., a picture for a Facebook post or pre-written text for a tweet)?",
      "text": "There isnâ€™t a blanket prohibition against asking an influencer to post a standard image that a brand provided. The question is whether posting the picture conveys something that isnâ€™t true or that is otherwise misleading. For example, say the picture communicates that the influencer used the product or had a particular experience with the product. If that isnâ€™t true, the use of the picture would be misleading.\nHiring multiple influencers to post pre-written posts raises a similar concern because endorsements must reflect the truthful experiences and opinions of the endorsers. There is nothing inherently wrong with using pre-written posts as long as the influencers are being truthful.",

      "title": "Iâ€™m a blogger. I heard that every time I mention a product on my blog, I have to say whether I got it for free or paid for it myself. Is that true?",

Nor is it an issue if you get the product for free because a store is giving out free samples to its customers. In those situations, your recommendation isnâ€™t a commercial practice covered by the FTC Act.\nThe FTC Act applies to product recommendations and other endorsements made on behalf of a sponsoring advertiser. For example, your product recommendation would be covered by the FTC Act if an advertiser â€“ or someone working for an advertiser â€“ pays you or gives you something of value to have you mention that product. If you receive free products or other perks with the expectation that youâ€™ll promote or discuss the advertiserâ€™s products in your blog, the FTC Act applies to you. Bloggers who are part of network marketing programs, where they sign up to receive free product samples in exchange for writing about them, also are subject to the FTC Act.",

      "title": "What if all I get from a company is a $1-off coupon, an entry in a sweepstakes or a contest, or a product worth only a few dollars? Does that still have to be disclosed?",
      "text": "The answer depends on whether knowing about that gift or incentive would affect the weight or credibility your readers give to your recommendation. If it could, you should disclose it. For example, if your endorsement of a product allows you to enter a sweepstakes to win a thousand dollars, it could very well affect how people view that endorsement. (See the Q&A below in the section entitled â€œSocial Media Contests. â€ Determining whether a small gift would affect the weight or credibility of an endorsement can be difficult. Itâ€™s always safer to disclose that information.\nAlso, even if getting one small item for free wouldnâ€™t affect the weight and credibility of your endorsement, continually getting free stuff from one or more advertisers could suggest that you expect future benefits from positive reviews. If you have a relationship with an advertiser that sends you free stuff in the hope of endorsements, itâ€™s best to let readers know about that relationship whenever you recommend that advertiserâ€™s products.\nEven an incentive with no financial value might affect the weight or credibility of an endorsement and would need to be disclosed. The Guides give the example of a restaurant patron who, before giving an opinion about a particular menu item, is offered the opportunity to appear in a TV ad. Because the chance to appear in the ad could sway what someone says, that incentive should be disclosed.",

Itâ€™s possible that some readers might think that the donation program makes reviewers more favorably inclined to your company and its product.

After some period of time, it probably wouldnâ€™t matter to them that you got the game for free. If youâ€™re choosing to play a game a year after you got it for free, it probably means you truly like it.

But just because a platform offers this feature is no guarantee that itâ€™s an effective way for influencers to disclose their material connection to a brand.\nIn an investigation, the FTC would evaluate whether the use of the tool by itself clearly and conspicuously discloses the relevant connection. Indeed, for any disclosure on social media, whether or not through the use of a platform tool, the FTC would consider several key factors in determining whether the disclosure is clear and conspicuous.\nOne factor is placement. The disclosure should catch usersâ€™ attention and be placed where they arenâ€™t likely to miss it. A key consideration here is how users view posts on a particular platform. For example, on a photo platform, users paging through their streams will likely look at the eye-catching images. Therefore, a disclosure placed above a photo may not attract their attention. Similarly, a disclosure in the lower corner of a video could be too easy for users to overlook.\nA second factor is readability. The disclosure should use a simple-to-read font with a contrasting background that makes it stand out.\nA third factor is clarity. The disclosure should be a worded in a way thatâ€™s clear, unambiguous, and understandable to the ordinary reader. For example, simply flagging that a video â€œcontains paid contentâ€ might not be sufficient if the video mentions multiple products or services without identifying which content is paid.\nThe big-picture point is that the ultimate responsibility for clearly and conspicuously disclosing a material connection rests with the influencer and the brand â€“ not the platform. To be on the safe side, itâ€™s always best to add your own disclosure even if a platform offers its own disclosure tool.\nIt would be highly beneficial if all social media platforms developed standardized, built-in disclosure tools that are easy for endorsers to use and easy for viewers to notice and understand, and if the platforms also tested the effectiveness of such disclosures. FTC staff is always willing to discuss that with any platforms that might want to make improvements.",

If you have an endorser under contract, you certainly should monitor them during the length of the contract and for a reasonable time, such as a few months, after the contract expires. If there was no contract and you just sent a free product, it would probably be reasonable to monitor endorsers for at least a few months. But there is no set time period that makes sense for all circumstances, and depending on the facts, you may be responsible for a post even after a few months.",
